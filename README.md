# Math IA Collisions
 
To use this simulation you need to be familiar with Unity, specifically how to change properties on a script in the inspector.
To adjust the mass ratio of the objects, go on the object named "2", and under the script called "Collision 2" there is a property called "N". Changing the number in that property will adjust the mass ratio of the objects.
